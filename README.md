# Shine On

This is intended to be a **mouse and keyboard game for 3 players and 5 hands**. More dextrous individuals can attempt this game with fewer players, but it is not recommended.


## Controls
Read on for details. The short version:
* Moving the mouse will move the targeting reticle
* Typing a key will fire a letter
* Alternate between the *numpad* and the *arrow keys* to move
-----

## Objective

You control a light in the sky, shining upon the world. The objective of the game is to keep your light shining for as long as possible.

* **Hitting CLOUDS** will cause your light to dim greatly. You can't afford to hit many.
* **Hitting STARS** will cause your light to dim very slightly.

You can gain score by destroying *clouds*. Destroying *clouds* is also recommended to for survival. 


## Moving

Moving is essential. You primarily move to avoid getting hit. Movement is done by alternating keypresses between the *numpad* and the *arrow keys*. You only can move a short distance per keypress. 

For example, in order to move up, you must alternate between pressing the *up arrow key* and the *numpad up key*. **Note that NumLock must be turned on**.


## Destroying Clouds

Typing a letter will cause a letter to fly towards your targeting reticle. The correct letters must hit a cloud in the correct order for the cloud to be marked.

Once all the letters in a section of a cloud are marked, that section can be right-clicked. Right-clicked sections will turn transcluscent to indicate that they are destroyed, and can be safely moved through.

Right-clicking all the segments of a cloud will cause it to be destroyed, earning you points.


## Bad things happening

Targeting reticles, letters you fire, and even yourself, can temporarily get slower. In general, making a mistake in one aspect of the game will cause other aspects to be more difficult. For example, letting the wrong letter run into a cloud will cause you to move slower. These slowdowns can happen by:

* Failing to alternate keyboard presses (e.g. pressing the arrow keys twice in a row)
* Colliding into a star
* Having the wrong letter collide with a cloud

Having too many slowdowns happen too quickly can cause you to move in the opposite direction.
